# note-taker-application

## User Story

* As a developer this week's challenge is to work on Express.js and the frontend is already being provided. I have to build a Note Taker. Express js will help to build the backend from where it will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

* It is to help a small business owner who wants to write and save notes. It helps in organizing the thought and keep a track of the task. Delete it when not needed.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I open the application I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.

* It's done when I click the "Get Started" link I am presented with a empty field on the right hand side, where I can add the note's title and note's text and on the left hand side are the list of the existing notes.

* It's done when I enter the notes I see the Save Button and Clear Form on the top right hand corner of the page. So when I click the save button its saved and can be seen on the left hand side list and the two buttons on the right hand side disappears.

* It's done if I click the Clear Note button the text which is written on the right soide of the page is cleared.

* It's done when I click on any saved task from left it appears on the right side of the page and a button comes on the top right hand corners stating "New Notes".

* It's done when I click the New Notes a blank page comes on the right where I can enter a new note.

* It's done if I click the bin button which is there by the side of every note, that note is deleted.
